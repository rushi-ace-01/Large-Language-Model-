# Large Language Model:
I gained a deep understanding of LLM and its construction from the book "Building a LLM from scratch"- by Sebastian Raschka
This repository contains code for building a LLM from scratch.
Code contains every detailed steps mentioned in the book.

A LLM is divide into three stages :

## Stage 1: Building an LLM
### Data preparation and sampling:
1. Creating Tokens
2. Creating token IDS
3. Adding special context tokens
4. Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
5. Creating Input- Target pairs
6. Implementing a Data loader
7. Creating token embeddings
8. Positional Embeddings

### Attention Mechanism:

1. Simplified Attention mechanism
2. Implementing self attention with trainable weights
3. Compact self attention
4. Casual attention
5. Multi head attention

## Stage 2: Foundation model
1. Training Loop
2. Model Evaluation
3. Load Pre-trained weights

## Stage 3: Finetuning 
1. Finetuning for classification
2. Finetuning for Instruction
